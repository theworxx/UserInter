Would I find that you would have a real time alert? Uh, yes. So 

Task 8: Which design of the described feature do you find ...
So which design of the described feature do you find most effective for your needs? I think design a Because it has more information on it. Um, that's far more useful to me. Uh, design a design, B looks a bit too simple and basic next.

Ok, um, I don't really want to give up the conversation because it's not that much. You're in the first place to give up. If it was more than proportionally, I would give some. Yes, that would be interesting. 

Task 12: Please describe what you see on this screen, focus...
Describe what you see on screen focusing on the list. What do you think is the purpose of identifying the top foods that affect your glucose level? OK, so it's a app on the phone. It looks nice and simple to read. Um, it's about the meals of the day being balanced or if it's high carbohydrates. Uh, what do you think? The purpose of identifying the top foods affect your glucose levels? Uh, well, it's obviously good to identify which foods do affect your glucose up and down. Um, and it's telling you which ones to avoid, uh, because they have, like, fructose and high glutose in it. Um, do I see myself utilising the feature to modify your diet? Yeah, it looks useful and interesting. I would definitely give it a go. Uh, looks like it might help. Um, And how important is this? Information for health management are very important for diabetes.

Um, OK, well, that does sound very interesting, so I'll give up some of it next 

Task 17: What information is being conveyed in these notifi...
time. Mhm. OK, so it's notifications. Uh, what's been conveyed? Um OK, it looks useful. Um, it's like identifying trends in food habits. Um, and suggesting that I have the high sugary snack before the walk and exercise to help neutralise it. Um, yeah, I think that could be helpful. It's sometimes good to have the reminder. Um, not that I forget, but, uh, just have a prompt sometimes to assist is helpful. Uh, how would I write the usefulness? Uh, yeah, it's very useful. Um, it's because it's giving, like a an a an actual suggestion. Like you can have a snack, the sugary snack. Oh, but if you have it for a walk and that will help And the second one is, um, it's about having a big evening meal, uh, suggesting that I have a similar larger meal at lunch time. So you had more time to for the body to, uh, normalise it. OK, Next,

Task 21: Please describe the alert on this screen and what ...
please describe the alert on screen and what it suggests. So based on the data, we found that just 20 minutes of moderate exercise, um, compulsively impact time and range and reducing glucose spikes. Exci and glass may not have the same benefits. OK, so it's just a helpful notification prompts, uh, letting me know that if I'm gonna do a walk well, I need to make it at least 20 minutes to count, because anything less is not as he as beneficial. Um, tomorrow. Yeah, I think that's, um, a useful tip for a daily routine. Try and get out for a 20 minute walk. Plus at lunch time, Um, helps to manage blood glucose and diabetes. Next.

What do you see in this notification? OK, so it's like an activity guide. Um, 30 minutes jogging, brisk walk for 40 minutes. Yoga. 45 minutes. So it's like giving me some active, uh, suggestions. Um, to help normalise. Yeah, I think that would be good to have, like, personalised activity guide. OK, Could be valuable. Um, would I be likely to follow it? Uh, maybe not every day, but having the the prompt is more likely to get me to do something. Um, for not having the prompt. Next,

Task 30: Can you describe the message displayed on this scr...
Ok, sleep. Yeah, really important for purpose. Um, yeah. So it's suggesting that sitting down too long and sleeping less will affect my energy levels. So suggesting, um, 20 minute walk to the market and saying that it could turn my day around? Yeah. Suggesting that I get seven hours of sleep and it will be a positive change to glucose levels tomorrow. Yeah, I think that's really important. Uh, very valuable sleep gives loss of, uh, benefits, Especially with the blood blood, uh, glucose levels next. Oh, I think so. The character features of it. Yeah. I like the key icon. It's quite quite fun. Uh, Alan, the character looks good. Next
